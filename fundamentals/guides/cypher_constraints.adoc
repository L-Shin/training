= Cypher: Constraints and Indexes

== Cypher: Constraints and Indexes

In this guide we're going to apply constraints and indexes to our movies dataset.

== Property existence constraint

Let's make sure people have names and movies have titles:

[source, cypher]
----
CREATE CONSTRAINT ON (p:Person)
ASSERT exists(p.name)
----

[source, cypher]
----
CREATE CONSTRAINT ON (m:Movie)
ASSERT exists(m.title)
----

== Indexes

We'll also add some indexes to allow quick lookup of nodes:

[source, cypher]
----
CREATE INDEX ON :Person(born)
----

[source, cypher]
----
CREATE INDEX ON :Movie(released);
----
