Facebook features  **Graph Search**, Google has the **Knowledge Graph**, and Twitter uses graphs to recommend people to follow.  Thousands of other companies are using graphs for everything from recommendations, logistics, bioinformatics to network management. Now you can access the power of graphs for modeling and querying your data without having to write your own database.

In this course, you'll learn about the power of graphs for retrieving more value from your connected data, the **Cypher** query language which brings the power of declarative queries to graph databases, and the Neo4j graph database engine which allows you to run those queries  much faster on commodity hardware.

So what are we waiting for? Let's start by answering the question - why would you use a graph database?
