While companies like Google and Facebook had to build their own graph engines, you can easily take advantage of the power of graph databases using the existing, proven Neo4j graph database.

Neo4j stores information in graphs comprised of **nodes** (actors, movies) and **relationships** between them (who ACTED_IN or DIRECTED a given movie). Both nodes and relationships have key:value **properties** (the name of an actor, the title or a movie or the roles that an actor played in a movie).

Working with graphs is all about matching patterns. Cypher is a powerful, SQL influenced language for declaratively specifying patterns and can be used to easily retrieve matching patterns from a graph.

In the next lesson we'll look at additional capabilities within Cypher for filtering and aggregating result sets more effectively.
