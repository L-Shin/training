== What is Neo4j

* Neo4j is a **Database** - use it to reliably *store information* and *find it later*
* Neo4j's data model is a **Graph**, in particular a **Property Graph**
* **Cypher** is Neo4j's graph query language (**SQL for graphs!**)
* Cypher is a declarative query language: it describes *what* you are interested in, not *how* it is acquired.
* Cypher is meant to be very *readable* and *expressive*

=== The Property Graph

//image::../../images/domain_model.png[]

* A **Property-Graph** consists of **labeled nodes** and **relationships** each with **properties**.
* **Nodes are just data records**, usually used for an entity (label).
Besides properties, they also contain their relationships to other nodes. 
* **Relationships connect two nodes**.
They are also an explicit data record in the graph database.
Think of them as containing shared information *between* two entities (direction, type, properties) and representing the connection to both nodes.

**Properties** are *key:value* pairs that allow you to store information in Neo4j.
Properties can be attached to both nodes and relationships and are referred to by `node.property` or `relationship.property`.
There is no schema, just structure.

So for example, an `Person` node might have a `name` property which could be set and retrieved using `actor.name` dot notation.
An actor might have played a character in a movie, so we have a relationship with the type `ACTED_IN`.
If we assigned an identifier `acting` to that relationship, we could get his or her `roles` using a `acting.roles` property.

Properties can be *boolean*, *numeric*, or *strings*.
They can also be *arrays* of any of these simple types.

Now that we understand the basic elements of a Neo4j graph, let's get started with Cypher for accessing our graph.
