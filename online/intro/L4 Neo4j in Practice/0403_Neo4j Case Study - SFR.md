# Neo4j Case Study - SFR

![](https://vimeo.com/77866848)

##Background
----------
SFR is the second largest communications company in France.

##Business Problem
----------------
It used to take a full week to plan infrastructure maintenance because of the time it took to model the potential network impact of downtime for individual components. They needed to be able to run rapid automated "what if" analysis to ensure resilience during network outages and to identify weaknesses in the network. 

##Solutions and Benefits
----------------------
Neo4j was implemented as the single source of truth to represent the entire network, loading data from 30+ different systems. The modeling efforts were greatly reduced because of the near 1:1 mapping between the real world and the graph.
