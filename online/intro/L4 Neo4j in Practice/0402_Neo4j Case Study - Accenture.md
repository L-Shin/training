# Neo4j Case Study - Accenture

![](https://vimeo.com/77867510)

##Background
----------
Accenture was hired to help one of the worlds largest logistic carriers to replace a system they were about to outgrow. They built a new parcel routing system to provide real-time routing of up to 5M parcels a day.

##Business Problem
----------------
The system had to provide 24x7 availability with a peak load of 2500+ parcels a second. It needed to work with a complex and diverse software stack and to provide predictable performance and linear scalability. It also needed to handle daily updates to the underlying logistics network.

##Solutions and Benefits
----------------------

Neo4j was a perfect fit for the domain as logistics networks are basically graphs. Neo4j clustering was used for availability and performance. The queries were much simpler to write and maintain when compared to graph style queries in a relational database, and the flexible data model made it easy to reflect real-world data variance.
