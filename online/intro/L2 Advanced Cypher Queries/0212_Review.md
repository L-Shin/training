There is always more to learn about querying with Cypher. It is a rich and powerful language that is well documented in the [Neo4j Manual](http://docs.neo4j.org/chunked/stable/cypher-query-lang.html) and the [Cypher Reference Card](http://docs.neo4j.org/refcard/2.0/), but we've learned a useful subset of the syntax and seen how we can describe powerful queries concisely.

To summarize the key elements of a Cypher query:

**MATCH** Matches the graph pattern in the real graph.
**WHERE** Filters using predicates or anchors pattern elements.
**RETURN** Returns and projects result data, also handles aggregation.
**ORDER BY** Sorts the query result.
**SKIP/LIMIT** Paginates the query result.

In the next lesson, we'll look at how we can edit a graph using Cypher.
