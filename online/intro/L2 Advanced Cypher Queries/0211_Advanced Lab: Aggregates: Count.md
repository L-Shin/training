##Recommend 3 actors that Keanu Reeves should work with (but hasnâ€™t).##

This is kind of a *friends-of-a-friend* query, only that we don't have `FRIEND` relationships here but co-acting in a movie (`ACTS_IN`). So it might be a bit verbose in the first place. There are different approaches for the recommendation. So keep in mind that the top 3 most frequently appearing people in that network seem to be good candidates.

Solution

<pre style="color:transparent">
MATCH (keanu:Person)-[:ACTED_IN]->()<-[:ACTED_IN]-(c),
      (c)-[:ACTED_IN]->()<-[:ACTED_IN]-(coc)
WHERE keanu.name="Keanu Reeves"
  AND NOT((keanu)-[:ACTED_IN]->()<-[:ACTED_IN]-(coc))
  AND coc <> keanu
RETURN coc.name, count(coc)
ORDER BY count(coc) DESC
LIMIT 3;
