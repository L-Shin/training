=== (L5) -- (Multi-System Integration)

Multiple database backend systems are a common setup in today's modern Enterprise architectures.
In general, there are two common practices we recommend taking into consideration while designing your application architecture:

* distributing the transactions in front of the databases or
* replicating data directly between systems

Both approaches will be discussed in this section.


==== Distributing transactions in front of the database

As the diagram illustrates, this architecture utilizes a service (such as a message queue) between the application layer and the database services tier.
The queue in this example stages data updates for each database system and may also be used by other services or business processes.
A secondary service then processes each update on each target system, possibly with a two-phase commit-like approach, to assure the data is updated in each location.

This approach is flexible in data processing and transformation for each database and provides for significant flexibility in growing the architecture and communicating with services.
However, it does require more logic between the database tier and the services to ensure updates are processed in all target systems.
And you'll want to ensure you have a routine for random data validation between systems to assure data is not diverging.

==== Replicating data between systems

A familiar choice for many administrators, this architecture involves an ETL-like process for moving data from one system to another target system.

When Neo4j is the target system, we recommend taking two possible approaches:

. Use a utility or system tool to extract data from the system of record into a CSV format.
You can then use the import utilities in Neo4j to transform and load the data directly into the database.
. Using a utility or service, pull the data from the system of record into a format that can then be transformed into transactions that are sent to Neo4j like regular database transactions.
In these cases, it is common to see data extracted in a format that can then be transformed into JSON documents and sent in transactions to Neo4j's REST endpoints.
