=== (L1) -- (General Deployment Options)

Early in the development of a solution, a decision will be made whether to deploy Neo4j as a standalone server or embedded within the solution.

Today the standard deployment of Neo4j is a typical client-server model, the most common approach among production deployments of Neo4j.

For other reasons the choice to embed Neo4j directly into the application may have been made.
This is more common in OEM setups, where Neo4j runs integrated as part of a third party product.

==== Embedded Deployments

When Neo4j is embedded directly into your application, you get all the functionality of the database directly accessible through the Java APIs right from your application code.
This makes it very easy to directly work with the database and get lightning fast performance.

===== Key Advantages of Embedded Mode

*Low latency*: Since Neo4j is in the application, there will be no network overhead.

*Choice of APIs*: Access to a diversity of APIs for creating and querying data via the Neo4j core API, traversal framework and Cypher query language.

====== For the Administrator

Your hands-on administration work with Neo4j is very minimal.
Most of the core admin tasks--such as initiating backups, monitoring, and configuration--should be built into the application that is embedding Neo4j.

==== Server Mode Deployments

In this architecture, Neo4j runs as a database server and can be accessed through binary and http APIs for data querying and updating.
It is a very familiar option similar to many server-based solutions.

==== Key Advantages of Server Mode

* *Binary "Bolt" Protocol* or HTTP APIs allowing clients to send requests and receive responses over the wire
* *Platform Independence* for the client/application accessing the server APIs due to dedicated language drivers
* Server and Query language extensions via user defined procedures
* Independent management of the database from the application
* Easy configuration and provisioning of Neo4j instances

==== For the Administrator

When deployed as a server, the administrator should expect to perform many common admin, configuration, and troubleshooting tasks as they would for any database deployment.
Neo4j provides utilities and tools for enabling these capabilities, which we will detail further in this course.
We will also detail the configuration and setup guidance that will aid the admin in ensuring a robust and stable deployment.

This course will primarily emphasize the production decisions and administrative tasks associated with a server-mode deployment.

==== Mixed Mode: Server and Embedded
// needs references

Mixed mode is exactly as it sounds: a combination of both embedded and server-based deployments of Neo4j in your architecture.
Two conditions must be fulfilled for this to be applicable:

. The mixed-mode instances are clustered with each other.
If they are not clustered together, you simply have two different deployment architectures for two different databases.
. You are using Enterprise Edition for both; it is not possible to cluster with Community Edition

===== Examples of reasons for mixed deployments

* In a cluster of embedded Neo4j instances, deploying a Neo4j instance in server mode for reporting purposes
* In a cluster of server mode Neo4j instances, deploying an embedded instance in a custom built departmental application that leverages the global graph data

There are no unique administrative approaches or requirements when you have a mixed-mode deployment.
We highlight it here simply to identify the possibility and note the reasons why this architecture may be chosen.
