=== (L2) -- (Neo4j Component Architecture)

Before we deploy, let's dive into the components that make up a complete Neo4j instance.
The internal components that make up a Neo4j instance are helpful to know so you better understand how implementation and configuration details affect the overall system.

.Neo4j Component Architecture

Neo4j is comprised of a very familiar component architecture.
It includes the files on disk that represent the database and logs for transactions, a cache for storing and working on data in memory, a transaction manager and an interface layer (query or API) for interacting with the database.
Let's look at each level separately.

==== Data on Disk - Neo4j Database Files

Neo4j database files are persisted to storage for long-term durability.
All the data related database files are persisted in the directory specified by the configuration parameters `dbms.directories.data` and `dbms.active_database` in the file `conf/neo4j.conf`.
If you leave the parameter's defaults in place, the database at the location `data/databases/graph.db` will be used.
The below table will give you an idea of the type of files you'll find, prefaced with `neostore.*` and what data they are storing.

[cols="<,<",frame="topbot",options="header,footer"]
|===
|Files |Description

|`neostore.nodestore.*`
|Stores node related data from your graph

|`neostore.relationship*`
|Stores data related to the relationships created and defined in your graph

|`neostore.propertystore.*`
|Stores the key/value properties from your database

|`neostore.labeltokenstore*`
|Stores index related label data from your graph
|===

Each of the files in this directory will make up your database.
Since Neo4j is a schema-less database, we use fixed record lengths to persist data and follow offsets in these files to know how to fetch data to answer queries.
The following table illustrates the fixed sizes Neo4j uses for the type of Java objects being stored.
Those fixed sizes may differ with regards to the record format (standard format vs. high limit format, see the configuration parameter `dbms.record_format`).

[options="header"]
|===
| Store File | Record size - standard | Record size - high limit | Contents
| neostore.nodestore.db | 15B | 16B | Nodes
| neostore.relationshipstore.db | 34B | 32B | Relationships
| neostore.propertystore.db | 41 B | 48 B | Properties for nodes and relationships (up to 4 per record)
| neostore.propertystore.db.strings | 128 B | 128 B | Long String properties (configurable record size)
| neostore.propertystore.db.arrays | 128 B | 128 B | Large array properties (configurable record size)
|===

You can approximate the size of your database on disk by multiplying the number of nodes, relationships, and properties by the record sizes used for each.
This will only be an approximation but can be very helpful when it comes to the hardware sizing.
Also, this will have an impact on the size of the page cache, which you should configure properly.
The cache and its configuration are discussed in more detail in the next section (L2).

==== Logging in Neo4j

Relevant database information and errors are logged to `$NEO4J_HOME/logs/neo4j.log`.

More detailed diagnostics, error messages and forensics are logged to `$NEO4J_HOME/logs/debug.log`.

Both files are rotated after reaching a certain, http://neo4j.com/docs/operations-manual/current/#configuration-settings[configurable size and time].

To get more detailed information about the memory allocation behavior you can enable Garbage Collection Logging, which is explained in a <<gc-logging>>.

For diagnostics on query performance it is possible to log Cypher queries that are slower that a http://neo4j.com/docs/operations-manual/current/#config_dbms.logs.query.enabled[configurable time] to a `$NEO4J_HOME/logs/query.log` file.
If necessary parameters for those queries can be configured to be logged as well.
Please note that for large amounts and sizes of parameters that can cause the log file to grow quickly.

The same is possible for http requests, which can be http://neo4j.com/docs/operations-manual/current/#config_dbms.logs.http.enabled[configured to be logged] to `$NEO4J_HOME/logs/http.log`

==== Transaction Management in Neo4j

In order to fully maintain data integrity and ensure good transactional behavior, Neo4j supports the ACID properties:

* *Atomicity*: If any part of a transaction fails, the database state is left unchanged.
* *Consistency*: Any transaction will leave the database in a consistent state.
* *Isolation*: During a transaction, modified data cannot be accessed by other operations.
* *Durability*: The DBMS can always recover the results of a committed transaction.

Specifically:

* All database operations that access the graph, indexes, or the schema must be performed in a transaction.
* The default isolation level is `read committed`.
* Data retrieved by traversals is not protected from modification by other transactions.
* Non-repeatable reads may occur (i.e., only write locks are acquired and held until the end of the transaction).
* You can manually acquire write locks on nodes and relationships to achieve higher levels of isolation (SERIALIZABLE).
* Locks are acquired at the Node and Relationship level.
* Deadlock detection is built into the core transaction management.

For production deployment purposes, much of the transaction management is outside the scope of this training.

==== Query and API Interfaces

Neo4j provides a query language called Cypher and a set of APIs for CRUD operations with the database.

Cypher is a declarative graph query language that allows for expressive and efficient querying and updating of the graph store.
Cypher is a relatively simple but powerful language.
Very complicated database queries can easily be expressed through Cypher.
Although outside the scope of this training, it is recommended that everyone working with Neo4j learns the basic Cypher syntax.
It is highly efficient in regard to querying the database for data validation and other checks.

Neo4j also provides Java APIs for database operations, which will most frequently be used when the database is embedded or if authoring Neo4j unmanaged extensions.
The documentation provides a complete overview of the APIs, but further details are outside the scope of this training.
