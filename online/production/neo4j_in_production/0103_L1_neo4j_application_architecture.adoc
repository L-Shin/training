=== (L1) -- (Neo4j Application Architecture)

As a database, Neo4j has a very familiar place in all application architectures.
It is used as a transactional, real-time store for highly connected data.

You connect to Neo4j from your application via the binary "Bolt" protocol, which is supported by the official language drivers.
Currently the drivers for .Net, Java, JavaScript, and Python are officially supported with other languages (e.g. PHP, Go, C/C++) being covered by community drivers.

To interact with the database, you use the open Cypher graph query language.
By sending one or more statements across the wire within each transaction you can read, create and update graph data and access additional features.

Built-in and user defined procedures provide support for additional functionality.

For production deployments, Neo4j can be run in clustered mode to support high availability and disaster recovery scenarios.
Then it also support live-backups and advanced monitoring.

You can run Neo4j in a variety of different setups, here some examples:

* Single application using Neo4j as primary database
* Graph heavy end user application backed by a Neo4j cluster as first database
* Existing application augmented with new functionality with Neo4j integrated and synced with other DBMS
* Neo4j as backing storage of cloud-hosted MicroServices, e.g. for recommendation or fraud detection
* Standalone Neo4j for graph-analytics in business intelligence
* Integration of Neo4j with graph compute solutions like Apache Spark, Apache Flink or Giraph
