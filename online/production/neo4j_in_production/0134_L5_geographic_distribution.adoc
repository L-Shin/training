=== (L5) -- (Geographic Distribution)

There are generally a few reasons you may want to choose to geographically distribute a Neo4j implementation.

. You'd like to bring the Neo4j data closer to the end user, especially if you have a global user population and end-user application response time is critical
. Geographic deployments can be used to provide disaster recovery capabilities
. Different regions require different access patterns or security practices

The Neo4j Enterprise Edition with a clustered deployment can seamlessly support a geographically distributed cluster meeting your requirements.

Within the cluster, the master instance will still service all writes for the entire global cluster.
Each region has a slave instance(s) that can support localized reads.
Important!
In these configurations, the slave instances should be configured to pull its replication data from the master on a longer interval (assuring efficient use of bandwidth and message bundling) and set as `ha.slave_only` in the cluster so it can never be elected master.
Otherwise, a geographically distributed slave instance could unintentionally be elected master and be too far from the intended application updates.

In this setup, you may still want to distribute writes to the master, even if the request is coming from a location within Europe.
An alternative would be to send writes to a slave within Europe, which in turn would need to communicate with the master in the US region.
Both the bandwidth and the cluster configuration (push/pull strategy) should be taken into consideration for both paths in order to decide on the best solution for your setup.
