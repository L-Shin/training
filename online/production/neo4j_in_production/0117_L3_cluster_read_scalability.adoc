=== (L3) -- (Cluster: Read Scalability)

As the title suggests, clustering Neo4j allows you to distribute read workload across a number of Neo4j instances.
You can take two approaches while scaling your reads with Neo4j: (a) distribute and load balance reads to any slave instance in the cluster, or (b) distribute direct reads to specific instances in the cluster.

==== Distribute and load balance reads to any slave instance in the cluster

Neo4j's clustering architecture replicates the entire database to each instance in your cluster.
As a result, you are able to direct any read from your application to any slave instance without much concern for data locality.

===== When would you choose this method?

. You need to scale up the number of concurrent read requests
. Your data has no natural or obvious way of partitioning reads
. A significant portion of the data that needs to be read can reasonably be expected to already be in memory on any instance in the cluster

.Replicate the entire database to each instance in your cluster

==== Distribute direct reads to specific instances in the cluster

// please review, this section is a bit confusing
Distributing direct reads to specific instances in the cluster is sometimes referred to as "cache-based partitioning".
The strategy simply allows you to take advantage of natural partitions in your data to direct reads to particular instances where the system will already have those datasets in memory.
This approach is particularly useful when your total active dataset is much larger than can fit in memory in any particular instance.

===== When would you choose this method?

. Your total active data set is larger than can reasonably be expected to fit in memory in any single instance in your cluster
. A natural or obvious partition can be identified in your dataset
. You have the application and operations ability to direct which instances are read from
