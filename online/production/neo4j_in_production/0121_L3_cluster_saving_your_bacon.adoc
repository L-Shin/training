=== (L3) -- (Cluster to save yourself)

We've looked at some logically sound reasons to cluster Neo4j:

. Read scalability
. High availability
. Disaster Recovery
. Analytics

But there is another sound reason not listed: saving your bacon.

Clustering offers many advantages for your deployments:

. It's an automatic, real-time backup of your database
. It can help assure additional data durability in the cluster
. You have an automatic failover solution without the need to invest in backup, redeploy and restart scripts and tools
. You can support the _ad hoc_ data requests without service impacts

Clustering Neo4j will support many of the functional application requirements that demand application uptime and consistency.
Now let's turn to a discussion on Neo4j's clustering basics and how to deploy it.
