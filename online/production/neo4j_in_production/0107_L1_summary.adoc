=== (L1) -- (Summary)

So we've made it through the first part of this course.
Here's what you now know about your Neo4j production deployment:

* You understand the basic architecture of applications deployed with Neo4j
* You know whether you are going to use Community or Enterprise edition
* You know to never use a Milestone or Release Candidate in production
* But you also know you can test Milestone and Release Candidates in a test environment to see how all the new features and functionalities work with your existing solution
* You understand the architectural deployment options

Now we'll turn to Neo4j itself and give you the knowledge you need to understand the server and its functions.

As mentioned previously, much of the following content will detail tools and utilities that are available to administrators of Neo4j instances running in Server mode.

We recommend reviewing the Neo4j documentation for specific details on configuring embedded deployments.
