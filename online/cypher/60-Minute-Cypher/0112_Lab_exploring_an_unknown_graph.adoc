== Lab: Exploring an Unknown Graph

In this video, we'll learn how you can use Cypher to easily explore and understand the structure of an unknown graph.

In general, labels often give good insight about the types of nodes in a graph.
Using Labels, you can return sample datasets to learn about properties and relationships usually attached to these nodes.

=== Learn about "People" in our Graph

Let's find out a little more about the people in the system by querying the various relationships of the nodes with a Person label attached to them.

=== Try to run and vary these queries
