== Your Turn

Now it's your turn to evolve the model further.

== Choose your dataset

Create a group with some of the people near you if you haven't already.

Once you've done that decide amongst you what you're going to do next.
Here are some suggestions of what we can add to the model:

* Additional airport data - `airports.csv`
* Flight delays and cancellations - see the `Cancelled`, `CancellationCode`, `*Delay` fields in the existing CSV files
* Aircraft - see the `tailNum` field in the existing CSV files + `aircraft.csv`

If you don't like any of these you can always import your dataset.

The `apoc` library has lots of procedures to help you import data from different sources.
See the link:https://neo4j-contrib.github.io/neo4j-apoc-procedures/#_data_integration[Data Integration] section of the manual for more details.

_Hint_ Whichever dataset you choose, try and think of some questions that you want to answer before you import the data.

== Wrapping up

Let's wrap up by going over what we've done today.

We hope you had fun in this session.
If you have feedback do let your trainer know so we can improve the course.
