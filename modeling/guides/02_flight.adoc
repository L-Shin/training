== Flight as a first class citizen

In this section we're going to refactor the model to make `Flight` and `Airline` first class citizens in our domain.
This refactoring will make it much easier to write queries centred around these concepts.

== Exploring the data

We'll start by exploring the flights CSV file by running the query below:

[source,cypher]
----
LOAD CSV WITH HEADERS FROM "file:///2008.csv" AS row
RETURN row
LIMIT 5
----


== Next Step

In the next section we're going to do something else, who knows what it'll be yet:

pass:a[<a play-topic='{guides}/02_flight.html'>Flight as a first class citizen</a>]
