== Exercise: Explore the graph

We've now loaded groups and topics but we don't know exactly what's in our graph so let's do some exploration.

* What's the most popular topic?
* Which group was created most recently?
* How many groups have been running for 4 years or more?

_Hint:_ The link:{refcard}[Cypher refcard] will come in handy for syntax we haven't covered yet!

==  What's the most popular topic?

[source,cypher,subs=attributes]
----
MATCH (t:Topic)<-[:HAS_TOPIC]-()
RETURN t.name, COUNT(*) AS count
ORDER BY count DESC
----

== Which group was created most recently?

[source,cypher,subs=attributes]
----
MATCH (g:Group)
RETURN g
ORDER BY g.created DESC
LIMIT 1
----

== How many groups have been running for at least 4 years?

[source,cypher,subs=attributes]
----
WITH (4 * 365 * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000) AS fourYears
MATCH (g:Group)
WHERE g.created < timestamp() - fourYears
RETURN g
----

== Find groups with 'Neo4j' or 'Data' in their name.

[source,cypher,subs=attributes]
----
MATCH (g:Group)
WHERE g.name CONTAINS 'Neo4j' OR g.name CONTAINS 'Data'
RETURN g
----


== What are the distinct topics for those groups ?

[source,cypher,subs=attributes]
----
MATCH (g:Group)-[:HAS_TOPIC]->(t:Topic)
WHERE g.name CONTAINS 'Neo4j' OR g.name CONTAINS 'Data'
RETURN t.name, count(*)
----
