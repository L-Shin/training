== Exercise: Importing venues

Before you start writing your LOAD CSV script you'll want to create a unique constraint on `:Venue(id)`:

[source,cypher]
----
CREATE CONSTRAINT ON (v:Venue)
ASSERT v.id IS UNIQUE
----

Once you've done that:

* Load the venues into the graph - make sure you store `latitude` and `longitude` as properties as we'll be using those in the next section.
* Connect the events we loaded earlier to our newly loaded venues

_Tip_ You'll have to iterate over the events CSV file again to get the `venue_id` for each event

== Load the venues into the graph

[source,cypher,subs=attributes]
----
LOAD CSV WITH HEADERS FROM "{csv-url}venues.csv" AS row
MERGE (venue:Venue {id: row.id})
ON CREATE SET venue.name = row.name,
              venue.latitude = tofloat(row.lat),
              venue.longitude = tofloat(row.lon),
              venue.address = row.address_1
----

== Connect events to venues

[source,cypher,subs=attributes]
----
LOAD CSV WITH HEADERS FROM "{csv-url}events.csv" AS row
MATCH (venue:Venue {id: row.venue_id})
MATCH (event:Event {id: row.id})
MERGE (event)-[:VENUE]->(venue)
----
