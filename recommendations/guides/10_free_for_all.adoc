== Your turn

What else can we add to the model to come up with more interesting recommendations?
Here you have some time to play around with the data and come up with something new

Here are some ideas that we thought of:

* Merge duplicate venues - can we write a query that finds duplicate venues?
* Social network - what events do our twitter/Facebook friends attend? Can we import that data and use it?
* Topic ontology - how are topics related? Can you find an ontology that we could encode in the graph?
* Event similarity based on descriptions - use Latent Dirichlet Allocation to derive categories
* Day of the week - do we only go to events on certain days of the week?  do we go to different events on weekdays vs weekend?
* meetup.com provides several streaming APIs - http://www.meetup.com/meetup_api/docs/stream/2/rsvps/#polling - can we use those to update the graph on the fly?

Or if none of those appeal you can try something of your own.

If we have time we'll let a few people show the group what they've come up with.

== Thank you for coming!

We hope you had a good day and if you have any suggestions for making the session better do let us know.

See you at our next meetup or event!
