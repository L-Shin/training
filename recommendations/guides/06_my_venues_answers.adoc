== Exercise: Events at my venues

At the moment our event recommendation query takes into account our groups, topics and the previous events we've been to but it doesn't take into account where those events were hosted which could be an important factor.
Let's now update the query to:

* calculate a score for events at venues that I've previously visited

You'll remember from the venues guide that we saw some venues appear many times under different names.
Let's also update the query to:

* calculate a score for events within 500 metres of venues that I've previously visited

to account for that problem with the data.
