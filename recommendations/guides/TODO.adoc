Things to do before Monday:

* For each of the recos have a slide / guide-page that highlights the pattern and the aggregation
* Cosine on the friendships that we computed using the stored proc
* Update the venues answers to take into account what we do in the events section
* Add an inferred property to the `INTERESTED_IN` relationships that we generate
