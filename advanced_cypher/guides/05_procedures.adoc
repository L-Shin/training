== Procedures

Neo4j 3.0 saw the introduction of procedures which allow us to write custom code in any JVM language, wrap it up in a function, and call it from Cypher.
Before we get started, let's get setup with the Awesome Procedures (`apoc`) set of procedures:

== Procedures

What sort of stuff do we want to show off with procedures here?

== Procedures (compare cypher statement with procedure)
- show a slow and optimized cypher-statement (I have a nice one from field)
- show how to turn that into a procedure and that it's much faster

== APOC
- show the different areas of APOC
- demo data-integration, graph-algos, conversion and collection functions
- perhaps reuse the presentation slides

== Spatial Functions
- distance and point functions
- show how to import and query
- also demo neo4j-spatial procedures
