== Handling of large tx (batching)
- large tx take too much memory, you can do 1M updates with 4G heap
- have to batch transactions
- with :Processed label and SKIP/LIMIT
- or APOC
- apoc.periodic.iterate, apoc.periodic.commit
- independent updates can be run in parallel (like updating nodes or just rel-properties)
