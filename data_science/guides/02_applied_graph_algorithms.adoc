== Applied Graph Algorithms

Welcome to the first of a set of interactive guides.
In these guides we'll learn how to use the Neo4j Graph Algorithms package.

Let's get started!


== Installing Graph Algorithms

* Go to the https://github.com/neo4j-contrib/neo4j-graph-algorithms/releases[Graph Algorithms releases page^] to find the latest release and download the binary jar.

* Place it in your `$NEO4J_HOME/plugins` folder.

* Restart Neo4j

* Run the following query to check it installed correctly:

```
CALL dbms.procedures()
YIELD name WHERE name STARTS WITH "algo"
RETURN count(*)
```

If we get a result of `0` it hasn't installed correctly.
Ask one of the trainers for help!
